# Pendulum Precision Measurement Virtual Platform - User Guide

## Introduction

The Pendulum Precision Measurement Virtual Platform is a tool for simulating pendulum motion, analyzing data, and precisely measuring gravitational acceleration. This platform is based on an accurate physical model that considers non-ideal factors such as air resistance, and it can be used for physics teaching and experimental data analysis.

## Installation Guide

### System Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Dependencies: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, ipywidgets (optional), IPython (optional)

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
python -m pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas ipywidgets IPython --proxy=http://127.0.0.1:7897
```

If you don't have a proxy, use the following command:

```bash
python -m pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas ipywidgets IPython
```

## Usage Instructions

### Command-line Operation

1. Open the command line, navigate to the project directory
2. Run the command: `python main.py`
3. Follow the prompts to select the experiment (1-4)

### Available Experiment Modes

1. **Basic Pendulum Simulation**: Simulate basic pendulum motion and visualize the results
2. **Theory vs. Experimental Data Comparison**: Compare ideal theoretical models with "experimental" data containing damping and noise
3. **Gravitational Acceleration Measurement Experiment**: Estimate gravitational acceleration by measuring periods at different pendulum lengths
4. **Interactive Mode**: Use interactive controls to adjust parameters in Jupyter Notebook environment (requires IPython support)

### Jupyter Notebook

The project also provides a Jupyter Notebook demonstration version:

1. Install Jupyter Notebook: `pip install notebook`
2. Run the command: `jupyter notebook`
3. Open the `pendulum_demo.ipynb` file in the browser

## Main Features

1. **High-Precision Pendulum Simulation**
   - Nonlinear pendulum equation with air resistance
   - High-precision numerical integrator
   - Visualization of pendulum motion trajectory and energy changes

2. **Precise Period Measurement**
   - Precise period calculation through zero-crossing method
   - Analysis of damping effects on period

3. **Gravitational Acceleration Measurement**
   - Calculating gravitational acceleration based on period formula
   - Using linear regression to analyze multiple measurement data

4. **Data Analysis and Visualization**
   - Theory vs. experimental data comparison
   - Error analysis and calculation
   - Data export in CSV format

## File Descriptions

- `main.py`: Main program entry
- `pendulum_simulation.py`: Core class for pendulum physics simulation
- `data_analyzer.py`: Data analysis and visualization module
- `pendulum_demo.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demonstration
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependency list

## Notes

1. When running on Windows, you may see warnings about missing Chinese fonts, but this won't affect functionality
2. Interactive mode requires Jupyter Notebook environment
3. If animations don't display, you may need to change the matplotlib backend settings

## Extended Applications

1. Teaching demonstrations: Intuitively demonstrate pendulum motion laws and energy changes
2. Experimental analysis: Compare ideal models with actual experimental data
3. Error analysis: Study how different factors affect measurement precision
